- **Introduction**

# CV-AIS Dataset

The CV-AIS dataset is designed for the fusion training of <span style="color:red;">AIS data</span> and <span style="color:blue;">video data</span>. It primarily consists of data collected from intelligent buoys deployed in Wuhu City, Anhui Province, China. This dataset provides a foundation for researching and developing models based on the fusion of <span style="color:red;">AIS data</span> and <span style="color:blue;">video data</span>.

The dataset includes:
- **Video Data**: Video clips collected by cameras installed on intelligent buoys.
- **AIS Data**: AIS data captured by AIS receivers in the Wuhu section of the Yangtze River during the same time period.

Currently, the dataset contains:
- **5 video clips** and their corresponding **AIS data** for the same time period.

This dataset is suitable for conducting simple data fusion experiments.

## Dataset Content

1. **Video Data**
   - **Source**: Cameras installed on intelligent buoys.
   - **Content**: The waterway environment of the Wuhu section of the Yangtze River.
   - **Duration**: Each video clip is several tens of seconds long.

2. **AIS Data**
   - **Source**: Synchronized AIS receivers.
   - **Coverage**: The Wuhu section of the Yangtze River.
   - **Timestamp Alignment**: Strictly aligned with the video timestamps.

## Applications

This dataset can be used for:
- Fusion analysis of AIS and video data.
- Research on shipping monitoring technology.
- Target detection and tracking based on combined AIS and video data.
